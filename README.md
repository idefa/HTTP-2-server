# HTTP-2-server

An implementation of the [HTTP/2 protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540) in .NET Core

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run a server based on this library you must have [.NET Core Runtime 2.1-Preview2](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.1.0-preview2-download.md) installed, as this is, as of today, the only version of .NET Core supporting SSL connection with ALPN negotiation.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
